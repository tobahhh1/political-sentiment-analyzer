# As the developer of the political sentiment analyzer app, I need to fine-tune my prompts until I have one that works well enough for students.

# Needs
# 1. Easy prompt input to kick off ML pipeline
# 2. Compare model performance vs. configurable expected by subreddit
# 3. Pick post CSV or YAML from a static hosted dir
# 4. Diff other experiments with same CSV / YAML
